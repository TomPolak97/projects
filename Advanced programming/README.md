# Opening the website:
# double-clicking on index.html.

# Short description:
# My site is a personal site that includes information about me,
# such as details about my education since I was a child, some photos,
# information about my experience, my hobbies, and more.

# JavaScript code:
# During the project I used JavaScript for the following purposes:
# 1. Creating a nice user experience when squeezing the browser -
#     displaying a menu on the side of the screen
#   (a button with a  shape of a hamburger that when clicked - displays the menu details).
# 2. Validation check from the user when entering a subject for the e-mail.
#   In addition, re-directing him to the e-mail service when filling in the e-mail subject and e-mail body.
# 3. A function responsible for displaying the collection of images using the carousel method
#       - displaying a different image from the collection of images every few seconds.
