In this project, we have implemented the ray tracing algorithm, a sophisticated rendering technique widely employed in computer graphics to replicate the intricate interplay of light with surfaces within a virtual scene. This algorithm traces rays of light through the scene, accurately emulating effects like reflections, shadows, and intricate lighting interactions. Through our implementation, we have achieved a remarkable level of realism in rendering, contributing to the lifelike visualization of the virtual environment.
