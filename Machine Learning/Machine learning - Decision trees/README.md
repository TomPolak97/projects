In this project, we've implemented the decision tree algorithm for versatile classification in machine learning. Our approach accommodates binary and multi-way decisions using both Gini impurity and entropy methods for data splitting. The result is an adept model that uncovers patterns and makes accurate classifications, showcasing the potential of machine learning in practical scenarios.
